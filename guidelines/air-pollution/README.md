## Protecting yourself out-doors
* Use the mask that can filter PM2.5. One mask can be used for 5-7 days. Buying in volume, it will cost about 5RMB per piece. 
* Using mask without PM2.5 filtration capability is not effective. 
* Avoid being outside for a extended period of time. 
* Avoid exercising outside when the air quality is bad. 
* Being in a vehicle does not protect you from the air pollution. 

### The 3M Masks 
There are different options for 3M masks. Here is how to recognize the model number. You will see the model number as 4 digit number with optional letter at the end. For example 9501V and 9002V. Noted that other brands can also effectively filter PM2.5 as well. 

**Mask model coding:**
```
Model number: [1][2][3][4][a]
[1][2] = Filtering capacity number in percentage. For example, 90 means it is 90% effective. The highest number you could find is 95%. 
[3] = This number is zero. 
[4] = This number represents the fitting mechanism. 1 is for ear loop and 2 is for over-the-head loop. 
[a] = This value is optional. The letter "V" indicates that the mask as a valve, this may make it easier to breath out. 

Example 
9501 = 95% effective, ear loop, without breath-out valve. 
9502V = 95% effective, head loop, breathing valve, sponge at the nose clip. 
9502V = 95% effective, head loop, breathing valve, NO sponge at the nose clip. 
```
